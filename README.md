# store-locations-iOS
Allows the user to store common locations they go to by category on their iOS device. Once they click on the location, they are redirected to the location in Apple Maps.


The iOS client written in Swift communicates with the Python REST API (Flask) to store the locations data into a local database made with SQLAlchemy.
